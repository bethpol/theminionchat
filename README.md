### Day 1: 4/22

Today, using CodeNinja, I figured out how websockets worked, did some de-bugging, and made the initial thing! Has some styling and limited functionality at the moment.

### Day 2: 4/23

Today I completed the CSS for the website to make it look pretty.

### Day 3: 4/24

Added some final touches with the frontend JS to make it pretty. Might revisit project later as I learn more about websockets. Put it on github to share/show code for feedback!
